# Grow Tent Monitor

A lightweight Raspberry Pi-based monitoring system for capturing and displaying live images of an indoor grow tent. Snapshots are taken at regular intervals using a USB webcam and displayed via a local Flask web dashboard.

This project is built to be modular and easily expandable with temperature, humidity, light, and soil sensors - perfect for smart garden automation or IoT portfolios.

## This project is still in progress and not yet complete! ðŸ˜Š

## Features

- Captures snapshots of your grow tent using a webcam
- Saves images with timestamps locally
- Displays a historical view in a browser-based dashboard
- Can be scheduled via `cron` or run manually
- Easily extendable with sensor data (temp, humidity, light, soil, etc.)
